# Note / To-Do App

Full stack web application that originally started as a university course project. At that time the app was e.g. using Firebase so there was no backend implementation, and the frontend was ok but not great. Later on I started working on this again as a personal project, building my own backend with NodeJS and rebuilding the frontend with more effort and care.

## Languages, frameworks and libraries used:

Backend: 
    - TypeScript 
    - Express
    - MongoDB (Mongoose) 
    - JWT
    - Bcrypt 
    - Zod

Frontend: 
    - TypeScript 
    - React (Vite) 
    - Axios 
    - React Router V6 
    - React Query (Tanstack) 
    - Zod

## Usage

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
