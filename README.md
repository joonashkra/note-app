# Note / To-Do Web Application

## Description

This originally started as some frontend-course project. At that time the app was e.g. using Firebase so there was no backend implementation, and also the frontend itself was not that great. Later on I started working on this again as a personal project, building my own backend and rebuilding the frontend with more effort and care. App is currently under development, but the basic features have been implemented for notes, authorization, etc.

## Languages, frameworks and libraries used:

Backend:

    - TypeScript
    - Express
    - MongoDB (Mongoose)
    - JWT
    - Bcrypt
    - Zod
    - Jest & Supertest

Frontend:

    - TypeScript
    - React (Vite)
    - Axios
    - React Router V6
    - React Query (Tanstack)
    - Zod

## Usage

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

cd backend

npm run dev
```
